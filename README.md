## Disclaimer
**The risk with using this on BNET is unclear. So if you're paranoid, DON'T use this outside of Single Player.**

## Known Issue
### Issue with tab selection
When closing and then opening the menu, your last selected tab is still selected even though the first tab is loaded. Switch tabs to correct this. I don't know how to fix this unfortunately.

## How to Use
You can access Runewords, Rune List, and Recipes via main menu by clicking the **Ancient Grimoire** button.

## How to install
1. Download **[AncientGrimoire.zip](https://github.com/d2-shadow/D2R-Ancient-Grimoire/releases/download/v1.0.1/AncientGrimoire-v1.0.1.zip)**.
2. Open BNET agent.
3. Navigate to ***Diablo II: Resurrected*** Tab.
4. Click the Gear Icon next to the ***Play*** button.
5. Click ***Game Settings***.
6. Tick ***Additional command line arguments*** and enter: `-mod AncientGrimoire -txt`
7. Open the folder listed under ***INSTALL LOCATION*** via ***Windows Explorer***.
8. Create a folder named ***mods*** in your ***INSTALL LOCATION*** folder if it doesn't already exist.
9. Extract the **AncientGrimoire** folder into the newly created ***mods*** folder.
10. Done. Have fun.
